## Installing VScode

A simple process really, to install VScode, all I had to do go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download right version for my PC. In my case I downloaded the windows ver. and installed it. Upon opending the application, everything seemed to run fine.

## Remotely Connecting

To remotely connect to the CSE15L account, I first had to make sure that I had OpenSSH installed, which allows me to connect to a server on my client. Thankfully it was already installed so all I had to do was open up a terminal and use `ssh username@hostname` to connect. Then, I had to enter the password for the account and bam... remote connection successful.
