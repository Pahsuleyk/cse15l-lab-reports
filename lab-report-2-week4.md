## Fixing Bugs

### Fix #1:

![Code Change 1](bugfix1.png)

This code change in the `MarkdownParse.java` file was meant to fix the very [first test file](https://github.com/henrigy/markdown-parser/blame/main/test-file2.md) we were given. This test file contained an extra line at the end which was empty and ended up causing an infinite loop to the tester. With this fix the tester was able to run the test fine with the extra line at the end.
